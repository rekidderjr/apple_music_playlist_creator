A tool to create and manage Apple Music playlists programmatically, with advanced music library analysis and sorting capabilities.

## Features

### Enhanced Music Library Analysis & Sorting
- **BPM Sorting**: Automatically categorizes tracks by tempo ranges (Slow, Moderate, Upbeat, Fast, Very Fast, Extreme)
- **Genre Sorting**: Creates playlists based on music genres from your library
- **Duplicate Removal**: Automatically removes duplicate tracks from playlists (same artist-song combinations)
- **Random Shuffling**: Randomly sorts tracks within playlists to avoid artist/album grouping
- **Library Statistics**: Provides detailed analysis of your music collection
- **Playlist Generation**: Creates .m3u playlist files compatible with Apple Music, iTunes, and other players

### New Enhanced Features
- **Library Data Analysis**: Diagnoses iTunes XML issues and missing file paths
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed feedback on playlist creation with file path validation
- **Missing File Detection**: Identifies tracks with invalid or missing file locations
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- **File Path Validation**: Checks if music files actually exist on disk

### Current Sorting Capabilities
**BPM (Beats Per Minute)**: Sorts tracks into tempo-based playlists  
**Genre**: Creates genre-specific playlists  
**Musical Key**: Not currently supported - iTunes/Apple Music Library XML does not contain musical key data (C Major, D Minor, etc.)

### Data Requirements
This tool requires your iTunes/Apple Music library XML file to be placed in the `data/` directory as `Library.xml`.

#### How to Export iTunes/Apple Music Library

**On macOS:**
1. Open **Music** app (or iTunes if using older macOS)
2. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Library** ‚Üí **Export Library...**
3. Choose XML format and save as `Library.xml`
4. Copy the file to `data/Library.xml` in this project directory

**On Windows:**
1. Open **iTunes**
2. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Library** ‚Üí **Export Library...**
3. Choose XML format and save as `Library.xml`  
4. Copy the file to `data/Library.xml` in this project directory

**Note:** The exported XML contains metadata like BPM, Genre, Artist, Album, but does **not** include musical key information. Musical key detection would require audio analysis, which is beyond the scope of this tool.

### Troubleshooting "Empty Playlist" Issues
If you're getting empty playlists, the enhanced version now provides detailed diagnostics:

- **Library Analysis**: Run the tool to see how many tracks have valid file paths
- **File Path Validation**: Checks if music files actually exist on your system
- **Missing Location Data**: Identifies if iTunes XML lacks file location information
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows exactly how many tracks were written vs. skipped

### Additional Features
- **Security First**: Comprehensive security scanning and compliance
- **Quality Assured**: Automated code quality checks and testing
- **Enterprise Ready**: Meets customer compliance requirements

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher (tested with Python 3.11.13)
- iTunes/Apple Music library XML file
- Additional requirements listed in `requirements.txt` (uses Python standard library only)

## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rekidderjr/apple-music-playlist-creator.git
cd apple-music-playlist-creator

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (development tools only - no runtime dependencies)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional)
pre-commit install

# Run compliance check (optional)
./customer-compliance-check.sh
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run compliance check
./customer-compliance-check.sh
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the complete setup and music sorter
./run_music_sorter.sh
```

### Manual Usage

```bash
# Run the music sorter (requires iTunes/Apple Music library XML)
python3 music_sorter.py
```

This will:
1. Parse your iTunes/Apple Music library XML file
2. **Analyze your music collection** for file path issues
3. Generate playlist files in the `playlists/` directory
4. Remove duplicate tracks from playlists
5. Randomly shuffle tracks to avoid artist/album grouping
6. **Display detailed statistics** about your library and any issues found
7. **Provide troubleshooting guidance** if problems are detected
